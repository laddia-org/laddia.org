**Louisiana AI Drug Development Infrastructure for ALS** (**LADDIA**) brings together leading institutions and innovators, including Tulane University, LSUâ€™s Pennington Biomedical Research Center, and GATC Health, to harness the power of artificial intelligence and one of the largest ALS datasets in the world.

This initiative is made possible through a commitment from the State of Louisiana to advance neuroscience research and innovation across the state. By investing in LADDIA, Louisiana is helping to position itself as a national leader in the convergence of AI and biomedical discovery.
