The Answer ALS Foundation, in partnership with the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Tulane University, and GATC Health, has received funding from the State of Louisiana to launch a statewide initiative establishing infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug development targeting ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). 

This consortium will:

- Contribute to the creation and design of Louisianaâ€™s first AI-based ALS drug discovery infrastructure
- Engage in collaborative projects with national AI drug development leaders
- Develop pilot and feasibility data to strengthen future grant applications
- Position their teams for future funding opportunities as the program expands into drug discovery and clinical research
